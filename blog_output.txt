**Title: Unveiling Agentic Rag Applications vs. Traditional Systems - A Deep Dive into Modern Generative AI**

---

### Introduction

Welcome to a new journey on my YouTube channel! Today I'm excited to delve deep and dissect the differences between traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, often referred to as conventional RAGs or LLM-based applications versus more advanced agentic Rag implementations. Whether you're studying for an AI-related interview course, curious about cutting-edge tech trends in generative models, or simply eager to expand your knowledge on this fascinating subject matter - I've got you covered.

### Main Content

Traditional RAG systems are well-known and widely used across various industries today; they typically involve combining user queries with prompt instructions which then get processed through large language model (LLM) responses. Picture it as asking a sophisticated data scientist to answer your questions, but in this case instead of direct answers you're providing them via prompts.

The beauty lies within the process: once you input your query into such systems they retrieve relevant information from an extensive knowledge base - essentially acting like our modern-day Sherlock Holmes! This retrieved content is then combined with user inputs and processed through LLMs to produce outputs that hopefully make sense, provide insight or even surprise us!

However, Krishna here brings up a thought-provoking aspect: what if we could push the boundaries of RAG systems further into an "agentic Rag" paradigm? Agentic rag refers specifically as enhancing performance by integrating vector databases within traditional retrieval-augmented generation applications.

Picture this - instead of solely relying on LLM responses to generate outputs after retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base, you have now incorporated complex algorithms that make use not only of the text retrieved but also additional context and relationships derived through Vector Databases (DBs).

These vector databases allow RAG systems an enhanced capability by storing information in ways other than plain-text - instead using vectors representing semantic similarities among different concepts. Krishna emphasizes how this integration could potentially result into more accurate, contextualized responses that take us beyond conventional LLM-based applications.

### Conclusion

So what do we have now? A new generation of RAG systems equipped with agentic capabilities through vector databases which may very well revolutionize the way generative AI operates today! 

Krishna here hopes to shed some light on this topic, and I encourage you all - whether you're studying for an upcoming interview or simply intrigued by cutting-edge technology trends in artificial intelligence â€“ understanding both traditional RAG systems along with their advanced counterparts can be incredibly beneficial.

Stay tuned as Krishna continues exploring the world of Generative AI! You might just find yourself pleasantly surprised on this enlightening journey together!
